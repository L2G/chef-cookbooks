This is a home for Chef cookbooks that I maintain for the Opscode Chef
community (or at least intend to maintain).

Each cookbook will be in at least one branch of its own, but usually two:
one for the released version, the other for the dev version being worked on.

Branches
========

* timezone-ii_dev - Fork of the timezone cookbook; not yet released
